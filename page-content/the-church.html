<h3>Get involved at Epic!</h3>

The local church is the hope of the world! Now that you are a part of the local church, here are some ways to get involved at Epic: 1) attend our weekly worship gatherings, 2) join a serving team, and 3) join a group.

<h4>The Church</h4>

<b>Why is the local church important?</b>

It is critically important that you get plugged in with a thriving, healthy church. In the Bible, God commands us to gather together as a spiritual family. God wants us to understand the importance of meeting together regularly with other people who are passionate about following him.

<i>Attend Worship Gatherings Regularly</i>

Our weekend gatherings are a place where direction and leadership are given to our church at-large. These gatherings are also the most common entry point for those new to Epic. These gatherings give us an opportunity to get everyone at Epic on the same page by studying common themes and moving together towards a common destination.

<i>Join a Group</i>

We believe that “together is better”. We believe that every person at Epic has something to give and something they need to receive from others.

<i>What’s an Epic Group like?</i>

Epic Groups are a great opportunity for you to build friendships, discuss the teaching from Sunday and serve the city together. Each group is made up of 15 or so people who meet weekly for about an hour and a half. During the meeting there is time to connect, discuss the text from Sunday, and pray together.

<i>What are the benefits of being in a group?</i>

Being in a group is a great opportunity to get to know other people and to be known. It provides a safe environment for us to grow spiritually no matter where you are on the faith journey by asking questions and learning from one another.

<i>Join A Team</i>

Without volunteers, the very things we enjoy on Sundays at Epic—coffee, music, lights, words to our favorite songs, programming for our kids—would not exist. Needless to say, volunteers are highly valued here!

More importantly, by serving in a volunteer team, we follow Jesus’s lead to serve. Jesus came to serve (Mark 10:45), and as we serve one another, we use our unique gifts to play a proactive part in our church, the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18-27).
