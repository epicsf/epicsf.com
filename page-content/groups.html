<h3>Join a Group Today!</h3>
We believe that life is meant to be shared and Epic Groups are an intentional way for people to do that. Joining a group is a great way for you to connect with others, grow in your faith, and serve the city. Groups are made up of 10-15 people and meet weekly to discuss the text and teaching from the Sunday service.
