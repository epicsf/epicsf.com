    <h3>Because Justice Matters</h3>
    <p class="body2">Because Justice Matters reaches women who have experienced sexual exploitation and domestic violence, and works to prevent the cycle of abuse faced by young girls. Since BJM started 7 years ago they have been building intentional relationships with women and seeking to support their healing process as well as introduce them to a relationship with Jesus. This summer BJM was invited into a local TL hotel to work with a very specific group of isolated women and children. It has been a powerful time of teaching ESL, offering parenting strategies and support, and being given the opportunity to build some deep and genuine relationships. BJM is excited to continue nail day outreach on Mondays, small healing groups and dance for young girls.</p>
