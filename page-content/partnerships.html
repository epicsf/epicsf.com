    <h3>City Impact</h3>
    <p class="body2">City Impact intervenes to break the cycle of poverty and despair in the Tenderloin neighborhood. For over 30 years they have accomplished this by bringing relief for those in urgent need, rehabilitation for those wanting a way out, and development to ensure the cycles of poverty and despair are not repeated. They accomplish this through several ministries and outreaches. This fall City Impact Academy has 120 children enrolled in the school where they were able to launch two new special needs classrooms. The Health and Wellness Center was proud to start a partnership with Kaiser, helping 366 TL residents secure a primary health provider.  City Impact continues outreach through the Rescue Mission, Adopt A Building, youth programs, and TL Made, a social enterprise.</p>

    <h3>Because Justice Matters</h3>
    <p class="body2">Because Justice Matters reaches women who have experienced sexual exploitation and domestic violence, and works to prevent the cycle of abuse faced by young girls. Since BJM started 7 years ago they have been building intentional relationships with women and seeking to support their healing process as well as introduce them to a relationship with Jesus. This summer BJM was invited into a local TL hotel to work with a very specific group of isolated women and children. It has been a powerful time of teaching ESL, offering parenting strategies and support, and being given the opportunity to build some deep and genuine relationships. BJM is excited to continue nail day outreach on Mondays, small healing groups and dance for young girls.</p>
